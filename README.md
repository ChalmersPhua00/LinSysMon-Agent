# LinSysMon-Agent
A CLI–based AI assistant for the Linux OS.

## Introduction
Instead of manually running Terminal commands, checking System Monitor, users can simply ask the agent questions like "Why is my internet slow?", "Find large files in my Documents folder", or "What services are running at startup?". Powered by GPT-4o and built upon MCP, the agent intelligently selects and executes specific system tools to diagnose issues, monitor performance, and retrieve hardware details in real-time.

## Requirements
- Linux operating system  
- OpenAI API key  
- Python 3.11 and above
